                <p>Pan Pudding (Japanese Milk Bread Pudding) is made with fluffy shokupan, eggs, milk, and sugar and topped with a delicious caramel sauce. The high ratio of custard gives this dish the texture of purin (the Japanese take on cr챔me caramel or flan) that simply melts in your mouth.</p>
